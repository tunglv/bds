Notice: I am abandoning this project.
=====================================

No offense to all the effort that went into this plugin, but it needs a lot of work to make it trouble-free. 
Also, most of us have used it only for styling of select elements, and paid no attention at all to the rest 
of the code.

Check out the [DropKick](https://github.com/JamieLottering/DropKick) plugin if you need to style selects

It's working well for me so far, and seems to provide a nice, clean code base for getting the job done.


Original README
---------------

This jQuery plugin was [created by DFC Engineering](http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/), and licensed under the GPL. I inherited it on a project, and needed to make some tweaks for our needs.

As modified, requires jQuery >= 1.4
